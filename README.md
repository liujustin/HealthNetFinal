# HealthNet

HealthNet is meant to provide a satisfactory experience for hospital patients to quickly access valuable information to medical records as well as set appointments with respective **Doctors** and **Nurses** and be able to quickly communicate with them.

The goal is to enable hospitals in the US to manage both employees and patients. HealthNet allows users to effortlessly sign-up as patients so that hospitals can manage procedures and patient related tasks such as create appointments and prescirbe medicine in order to optimize day-to-day work-flow. Ultimately, HealthNet will improve hospitals by providing employees with an easy mechanism to manage other employees, gather staistical data on the inner workings of the hospital, sign-up of patients, creation of appointments and ease of trasnfer for both patients and their information between hospitals.
